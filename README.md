A text based game meant to be a less fledged out clone of "The Labyrinth" found on thuum.org (https://www.thuum.org/labyrinth.php).

The game is in the setting of the elder scrolls world, specifically Skyrim. You pick your race and you set off on your adventure through the labyrinth to defeat the final boss, Alduin.
The instructions on how to play are provided when the game is run.
If you are lost, type 'uth' for a list of commands.

TO PLAY:
Download and run TheLabyrinth.py
...That's it

Have fun :)
